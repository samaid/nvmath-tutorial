    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**nvmath-python** is powerful library designed to bridge the gap between Python's scientific computing community and **NVIDIA's CUDA-X math libraries**. The community has done a decent work in enabling GPU computing through **CuPy** and **PyTorch** and some other libraries and frameworks. They all leverage a goodness  of NVIDIA CUDA-X math libraries, such as cuBLAS and cuFFT, and demonstrate amazing performance gains compared to CPU libraries. At the same time, being constrained to *NumPy-like* APIs these GPU libraries do not always exploit full potential and advanced features of underlying NVIDIA CUDA-X libraries. This is where nvmath-python may become handy. It reimagined how math library API design can be intuitive, pythonic, and yet performant in sophisticated usage scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like other *NumPy-like* libraries, nvmath-python implements core numerical algorithms useful in many scientific and engineering fields. However, nvmath-python does not aim to replace or duplicate them. First and foremost, nvmath-python **is NOT** an *array library*, it does not implement traditional array library functionality, such as array *indexing* and *slicing*."

    "Since GPU kernels are launched asynchronously, a host call may return before the device work finishes. Naive timing (e.g. Python's `time.time()` method or Jupyter's `%%timeit`) measures only host-side overhead, not true device execution time. The `cupyx.profiler.benchmark` uses CUDA events, proper synchronization, warm-ups, and repeated runs to produce stable, device-level timing measurements. It removes much of the noise introduced by Python overhead, one-time setup costs, and asynchronous execution and reports aggregated statistics so you get reproducible, comparable numbers."
